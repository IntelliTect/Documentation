## Introduction
Carbon is an easy to utilize tool that allows rapid duplication of CCB and MDM accounts for training and testing. It is designed to simplify any project where identical or similar accounts are required. Carbon provides a simplified and consistent environment that students can use for practice multiple times, or enabling testers to replicate problematic accounts in a development environment allowing simple and streamlined approach to solving the issue.

## Getting Started
This documentation provides information on Carbon by Intellitect. 
### Training
Carbon allows trainers to create many copies of a single account from any environment quickly to allow all trainees to work with the same accounts in the same scenarios.

### Testing
With Carbon, accounts can be replicated from production and between development and testing environments. You never have to determine problematic accounts in production. Simply replicate it in a test environment.
