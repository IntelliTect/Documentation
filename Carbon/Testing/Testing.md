# Testing
With Carbon, accounts can be replicated from production and between development and testing environments. Carbon assists with:
* Problematic accounts: Issues can easily be located and fixed by replicating the account into the development environment.
* Testing accounts: Replica accounts can be tested first to confirm the veracity of the fix before testing
on the original account. The original account remains pristine until the correct fix is found.
* Automation testing: Never run out of accounts.
