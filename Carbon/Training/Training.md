## Training
Carbon allows trainers to create many copies of a single account from any environment that meets their scenario requirements. Carbon makes training:
* Easier to prepare: The time required to prepare the accounts for training can be reduced by an order of magnitude.
* Consistent: All trainees have the same experience.
No longer does the trainer have to deal with issues
related to each trainee having a different account.
* Robust: Each CSR can practice the scenario several
times. More replicas of accounts can be made quickly
and on the fly, if necessary.
* Simplified: All training is done in one environment.
