# Download Tokenized SQL for a Snapshot or Change package
Sometimes a database is needed in multiple enviornments. But what if the database contains enviornment-specific data that would require a different copy for each enviornment? Thats where Trellis comes in. You can store the enviornment-specific data in tokens that are replaced by variables.

* Start by creating or viewing [a Comparison](Comparing-Snapshots.md) or [Change Package](Creating-Change-Packages.md)
* From the change package overview screen select the "Download Tokenized SQL" button in the upper righthand corner of the header
* Select the location to save
