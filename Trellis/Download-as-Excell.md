# Download an Excel File for a Snapshot or Change package

While Trellis makes it easy to view and track changes in many different environments, not everyone has it available. Luckily you can share this data using Microsoft Excel files.

* Start by creating or viewing [a Comparison](Snapshot-Comparisons.md) or [Change Package](Change-Packages.md)
* From the change package overview screen select the `Download Excel` button in the upper right-hand corner of the header
* Select the location to save

Now you have a concise, easily transferable copy of all the changes.
