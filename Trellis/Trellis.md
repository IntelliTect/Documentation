# Introduction
Trellis is a web-based configuration tool designed for large enterprise applications. It allows users to track and affect change within and between
environments in an efficient manner while limiting human errorsâ€”at the click of a button. Additionally, snapshots of the configuration data are periodically recorded and users can be alerted if changes are made. Trellis is a valuable addition to any team using CCB or MDM.
