# Download Tokenized SQL for a Snapshot or Change package 
 
If you have used [tokens](Use-Tokens.md) within your application databases then you might want to download the tokenized SQL. Trellis will look through the database and find anywhere a token was used, and it will swap it with a SQL variable. The SQL variable will be declared at the top of the file. Generally, this is used infrequently. 
 
* Start by creating or viewing [a Comparison](Snapshot-Comparisons.md) or [Change Package](Change-Packages.md) 
* From the change package overview screen select the `Download Tokenized SQL` button in the upper right-hand corner of the header 
* Select the location to save
